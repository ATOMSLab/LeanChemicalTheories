# Chemical Theories in Lean

The repository is a collection of lean documentation created to formalize theorem statements and proofs 
in chemical sciences and engineering hosted at https://atomslab.github.io/LeanChemicalTheories/ using [doc-gen] (https://github.com/ATOMSLab/doc-gen/tree/master).

The detailed instructions to install Lean, mathlib, and supporting tools are on the official [Lean website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).
