# Chemical Theories in Lean

The repository is a collection of lean documentation created to formalize theorem statements and proofs 
in chemical sciences and engineering hosted at https://atomslab.github.io/LeanChemicalTheories/ using [doc-gen](https://github.com/ATOMSLab/doc-gen/tree/master).

A detailed descritpion of this work is published as [Formalizing Chemical Theory using the Lean Theorem Prover](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12150) in the arXiv.

The detailed instructions to install Lean, mathlib, and supporting tools are on the official [Lean website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).
