x, our position function, has a derivative and that derivative is the function v, which
is our velocity function. At each t, v t is the evaluation of the velocity function
at t which is the slope of the tangent line, basically saying x(t) = dv(t)/dt-/

at t which is the slope of the tangent line, basically saying v(t) = da(t)/dt-/

to the lamda function which takes in a t and outputs Œ±. This function is a constant function,
because no matter what value of t is put in, it always outputs the same value, Œ±. da/dt = 0,

Œ± and intercept v‚ÇÄ, which is our initial velocity. We say there exists a v‚ÇÄ, which is our
integration constant.-/
