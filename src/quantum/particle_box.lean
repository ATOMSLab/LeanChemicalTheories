/-Here we define the derivation of the wave function for a particle in a well (box) with infinite
potential energy at the boundaries. We begin with a 1-D box and generalize to a n-D box

To begin, we define a Hilbert space, which is our function space. Then, we can say that our
wave function is an element of the function space-/
